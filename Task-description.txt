Okay got it let me repeat again what i am gonna start with tomorrow
1. Duplicate importCal project and call it chatListener
2. Add a new page similar to what we have added in Event_Dashboard project with a calendar view and chat
3. Then allow user to have conversation
4. Read all uploaded ICS files context or selected files context depend on user.
4. Add Indicators in our AI chat support that when ever AI things an event is going to change or user have requested something which can impact a change in an event then we should show that message which you mentioned.
5. The AI indicators should work as expected with users choice.

3. Make sure you connect the import function to this page.
It’s like the next step after import and it becomes like the default page

4. To me it seems that we should be converting the import ICS to json and storing it. Making sure we map each ICS id file to the json file
 
 Make sure you’re using regexp for indications do not do anything else, but that before you pass to GPT
